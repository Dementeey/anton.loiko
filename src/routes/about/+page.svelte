		and enhancing user experience through innovative JavaScript solutions. Proficient in React,
		TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, and Vue.js. Committed to continuous learning and improvement,
		always exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of the industry. Looking for new
		challenges to apply my expertise and contribute to impactful projects.
	</p>

	<p class="font-roboto text-white mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
		From my work, I expect continuous professional growth and development opportunities. I notice
		leadership qualities in myself, such as advocating for my team members and organizing team
		efforts.
	</p>

	<p class="font-roboto text-white mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
		I strive to work in a dynamic and innovative environment where I can apply my knowledge and
		experience to solve complex problems and create valuable products. Working with a team of
		professionals who value collaborative effort and knowledge sharing is important to me.
	</p>

	<p class="font-roboto text-white mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
		I also value a balance between work and personal life, so having a flexible schedule and
		maintaining a healthy work atmosphere are crucial. I prefer to avoid monotonous tasks and thrive
		in environments that allow for creativity and innovation. Honest and transparent communication
		within the team and with management is also important to me.
	</p>

	<p class="font-roboto text-white mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
		What I do not want from work is limited opportunities for professional growth, lack of learning
		and development opportunities. I do not want to work in an environment where support and team
		interaction are absent, and where the opinions and ideas of each team member are not valued.
		Additionally, I aim to avoid roles that do not offer opportunities for creativity and personal
		growth.
	</p>

	<p class="font-roboto text-white mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
		In summary, I am seeking a role that fosters my growth, allows me to contribute to team success,
		and enables me to develop both professionally and personally.
